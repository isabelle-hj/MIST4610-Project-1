# Problem Description:

We have been tasked with modeling and building a relational data model for an emergency healthcare clinic. For this project, ChatGPT acted as the owner and operator of this clinic. We asked it for the data it thought was the most important to model, and we developed our model from there. Some of the entities we are interested in are the clinic staff, services it provides, and patients it treats, as well as keeping track of facilities and inventory. We also performed several queries using the data model that could be used to provide key insights into the operations of the clinic.
